Known Issues:

Duplicate account issue: 
The way user log in validation is done is by checking if the username and password combination returns exactly one result
from the database, however it is possible of a user to create a new account with the same username and password combination as an existing
user but with a different email. This will cause the login validation to fail. This is a simple fix as we can just make a user enter a unique 
username as well as email.
